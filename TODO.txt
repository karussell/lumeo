check if all methods are implemented

lucene already has a cache but we need to access documents via ID

make things thread safe. 
   lock access to put - adding an edge is not an atomic access to the map
   delete + put may result in missing or duplicate entries

make tests passing

instead of storing -> use only one _source field

use CachingWrapperFilter?

use FilteredDocIdSet to better traverse a prefiltered graph

remove difference of edge and vertex in/out ? 
    this or something else would be necessary if we introduce shortcut from vertex to vertex

use trove collection where possible (e.g. for uncommited buffer?)

improve ID lookup via LUCENE 4.0 see http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2010/06/lucenes-pulsingcodec-on-primary-key.html
    indexWriterConfig.setCodecProvider()

faster field fetching via doc values

check if lucene searchers/readers are properly closed
use blueprint tests to see what fails
