make cool stuff working under LuceneGraphTest (somefield_t and do only store fields which are not in propertyKey)
check type filtering (e.g. create edge + vertex of same userId!)

make things thread safe. 
   lock access to put - adding an edge is not an atomic access to the map
   delete + put may result in missing or duplicate entries

check if all methods are implemented
make tests passing

remove difference of edge and vertex in/out ? 
    this or something else would be necessary if we introduce shortcut from vertex to vertex

faster field fetching via doc values

check if lucene searchers/readers are properly closed
use blueprint tests to see what fails
